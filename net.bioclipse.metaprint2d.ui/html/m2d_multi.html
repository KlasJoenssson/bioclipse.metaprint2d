<h1>MetaPrint2D - Multiple Molecules</h1>

To use MetaPrint2D on multiple molecules, double-click on a file that contains 
multiple molecules, for example an SDFile. This opens the Molecules Table, and by clicking the 
one of the buttons in the <a href="m2d_menuToolbar.html">MetaPrint2D toolbar</a>, 
MetaPrint2D is invoked and structures colored like below.

<p>
Like for single molecules, the results are visualized so that atoms are colored according to the likelihood 
of a metabolic site being centred on this atom: High: red, Medium: yellow, Low: green, 
and Very low is not coloured.

<h2>Editing individual molecules</h2>
You can easily show/edit individual molecules from the Molecules Table. 
Simply select a molecule by clicking on it, then, in the bottom of the editor area, 
choose the tab <b>2D-structure</b>. This switches to single molecule view of 
chemical structures where you can edit and re-run MetaPrint2D, and switch back to 
the tab <b>Molecules</b> when you want to proceed to the next entry.
